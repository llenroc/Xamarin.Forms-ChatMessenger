# Xamarin.Forms-ChatMessenger
Uses the JSQmessages component and makes it work with Xamarin.forms.  It is meant currently only for iOS. 

The code is documented.

It works such that there is a ChatPageRenderer in the iOS solution. It uses that with the JSQMessages Component for Xamarin. Feel free to use as you wish.
